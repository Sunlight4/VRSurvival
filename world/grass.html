Grass

<image src="/grass.png" alt="Grass">

ID: 3
Hardness: 2
Type: Block

Grass is a commonly found block at the top layer of a world, specifically at y 304.
It takes 10 seconds to break, and is one of the weakest blocks in the game.
As of vsurvival 1.0, it currently has no purpose, like any other block in the game.
